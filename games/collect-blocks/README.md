# Game - Collect the blocks

[Anleitung auf Deutsch](games/collect-blocks/README_DE.md)

Possible walkthrough for working with kids:

* Run the 'helloWorld' to see how it works.
* Set first blocks programmatically.
* <span style="color:gray;">Reset the player on start to defined coordinates.</span>
* Introduce the concept of a while-loop.
* Poll the block hit events and print them to see what happens.
* <span style="color:gray;">Set world immutable to avoid destroying the world without a hit event triggered
(hit event only by sword with right mouse button)</span>
* Introduce the concept of a for-in-loop.
* Introduce the concept of a if-conditions.
* Only print something if a specific block-type was hit.
* Add concept of points.

<span style="color:gray;">These are optional</span>
